coin detection using image processing for fixed camera angle and distance(modification asked by sir)
step:
1)go to code for coin recognition without different ratio(modified)
2)the mai file is used to detect the denomination of the coin
3)coindetect file is used for classifing different coins based on radius
4)merkz file is used to detect the  centroid of the coin
5)to get result run the mai file in matlab by entering the test images names to get there denominations 

coin detection using image processing for varing camera angle and distance(not in project extra if needed)
1)go to code for different ratio
2)to get result run the test file in matlab to get the denominations of all test images
this is used mainly to get denomination of coins when we are not knowing the distance of camera and coins and angle of camera ..
thank you
